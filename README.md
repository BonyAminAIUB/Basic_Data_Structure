# Basic Data Structures 📚

This repository contains **C++ implementations of fundamental data structure concepts**.  
It is created to build a strong foundation in **Data Structures** by understanding how each structure works internally.

---

Each folder includes **example implementations and basic demonstrations** of the corresponding data structure.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List (Singly & Doubly)
- Stack
- Queue
- Recursion
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how basic data structures work internally  
- Learn when and where to use each data structure  
- Improve problem-solving skills using DSA  
- Prepare for university exams and coding interviews  

---

## 📈 Learning Level
- Beginner friendly  
- Gradually moving towards intermediate concepts  

---

## ⚠ Note
This is a **learning repository**.  
Some implementations may be simple or not fully optimized, as the goal is to understand core concepts first.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Optimized implementations
- More practice problems
